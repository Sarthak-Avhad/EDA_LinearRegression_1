# EDA_LinearRegression_1

📊 Project Overview

This project uses the Insurance Charges dataset to analyze how personal and lifestyle factors (such as age, BMI, smoking habits, etc.) influence medical insurance costs.
Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and a Linear Regression model, the goal is to predict insurance charges and understand which factors contribute the most.


🗂 Dataset Description 

The dataset contains demographic and health-related details of individuals such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status, region, and the medical charges they were billed.
It is commonly used for regression tasks to predict insurance costs based on lifestyle and risk factors.



📝 Key Analysis

Age & BMI Trends: How health and age affect insurance charges

Smoker vs Non-Smoker: Major cost difference

Region & Children: Influence of household and location

Correlation Heatmap: Finding the strongest predictors

Linear Regression Fit: Actual vs predicted cost visualization



📜 Conclusion

This project shows how Linear Regression can effectively predict medical insurance costs and identify key factors influencing them. It provides valuable insights for insurance companies, healthcare analysts, and ML beginners.
